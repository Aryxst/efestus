Efestus is a Discord bot confusing yet powerful because of the tools it was built with. Its written in full typescript and developed in the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) Runtime.

- ⚡ **Fast**: Efestus is built with Bun, the all-in-one Javascript runtime built for speed;
- 🚀 **Optimization First**: 
    - Database experience is enhanced by Bun's `sqlite` module;
    - Delegate resource-intensive tasks to background processes, freeing up the main thread;
- 🧪 **Customizable**: The codebase its quite simple to understand.


⚠️ Warning
